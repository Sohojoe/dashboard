#Tags

With Zotero you can add descriptive keywords, so-called *tags*, to items, files, links and notes. Together with collections, tags can help you organize your Zotero library.

How do tags differ from collections? First, tags in Zotero are not hierarchical, whereas collections can have subcollections. Secondly, tags are more portable than collections: many export formats (like RIS) save your tags, but few support collections.
